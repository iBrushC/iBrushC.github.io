                            Hi! My name is Andrew Combs, and as of writing this
                            I'm a first year Electrical Engineering student at
                            North Carolina State University. I am an avid maker
                            and programmer, and love challenging myself with
                            projects. My favorite projects generally involve
                            simulations or creating sci-fi technology.
                        </p>
                        <p class="topspace">
                            Outside of making stuff, I'm also a bread baker,
                            chef, freerunner, chess player, 3D artist, and rock
                            climber.

                                every major programming language, but I'm most
                                confident with Python, JavaScript, C, C++, Rust,
                                and a handful of shading languages.

                                mount. I also know the ins and outs of 3D
                                printing and am trained in shop safety.

                                    of the most influential and widely used
                                    extensions in the field and got me invited
